PHILOSOPHY
==========
GSVmind has been developed with several principles, practices and patters in mind (the famous P.P.P), most of them complementary.
The [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is one of them, and its one of the most important ones, as it comprises 
in a few lines the idea of "Clean Code".

A readable (meaningfull names, meaningfull comments) well structured code (modularity, clear interfaces, high cohesion and low coupling)
is the ultimage goal.

Besides, the project has been used as a sandbox to exercise the [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). 
Requirements specification is also
exercised. In fact, both processes are intertwined, as [Contributions](@TODO) chapter shows.

Finally, this very documentation of the Wiki, the [branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
at GitHub, issue tracker templates and others aspects of the project like
the directory hierachy aims to make this project easy: to understand, to use, to expand...

Users shall decide if it is achieved or not.
