PROJECT CONTENT
===============
GSVmind project is hosted at GitHub @TODO. It contains a wiki (ahem), an issue tracker, and two main branches: master and development.

The project content is organized in the following "5S Methodology" directory hierarchy. The goal is to provide a directory structure that
is easy to follow and where "everything has a place, and there is a place for everything".

(@TODO)

Below, a description of each folder:

- The root directory contains the repository "front end" files: the installation script, the VCS files (README, LICENSE, yaml and git files)
and the "Project" directory, containing the project data (source code, makefiles, requirements, tests, traceability data, etc.)
- Project directory provides a "def" folder and a "prototype" folder:
    - The "def" folder contains the DEFinitive project - the data that is being developed and tested to be released.
    - The "prototype" folder contains any state of the art component, proof of concept, initial test, learning data or research in progress.
	The prototype folder is used as a "sandbox", a place to play and break things without any consequence.
- Inside the definitive folder, several ones can appear. Because the current project only comprises software, only the SW folder appears.
- SW folder is then divided in the main "triforce":
    - Doc folder contains all documentation files: media (images, sounds), the wiki pages, and templates (script templates, source code templates).
    - Scripts folder contains all scripts used in the project, of any kind and no matter the purpose.
    - Dev folder, loosely following the typical "Waterfall moderl" provides a folder for each process of the development methodology.
    Here is where the requirements, the design, the source code and the tests are stored.
