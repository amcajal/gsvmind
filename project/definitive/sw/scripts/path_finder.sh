#
#   Description: This script searches for "./" and "../" in all the files
#		under the <root_dir>. Its goal is to check all places where
#		references to relative paths are used.
#
#               Usage: $ path_finder.sh <root_dir>
#               <root_dir> root directory from where search process starts.
#
#   Notes: This script is named like one of the Mars Spacecrafts. It cannot be cooler.
